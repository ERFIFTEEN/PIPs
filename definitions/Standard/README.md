# About Standard Type PIP - Definition / Specs

A Standards Track PIP describes any change that affects most or all Push protocol implementations, such as changes in core, interface, networking or application level standards. They are broken down into the following categories.

1. **Core**: includes improvements for changes in the network including incentives and rewards, syncing, consensus mechanism changes and processes that might require fork cause of breaking changes.

2. **Interface**: includes improvements around client API/RPC specifications and standards, and also certain language-level standards that may help in standardizing interfacing.

3. **Networking**: includes networking specifications and proposals around how push nodes communicate and interoperate.

4. **PRC**: Signifies, application-level standards and conventions, including verification, identity, payloads, content markdown for notifications, chats or any communication standard that is added.
