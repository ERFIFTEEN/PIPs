## What is Push Chat?

Push Chat is a web3 messaging protocol that enables wallet addresses to send and receive messages, offering a secure and privacy-focused alternative to traditional messaging apps. By leveraging blockchain technology, users can communicate directly via their wallet addresses without personal identifiers like phone numbers. Designed for mainstream adoption, Push Chat serves as a protocol that any dApp, web3 wallet, or backend can integrate to provide their users with messaging capabilities. Additionally, chat messages in Push Chat come with built-in notifications, similar to what users are accustomed to in web2 messaging platforms, ensuring a familiar and convenient user experience. This combination of features makes Push Chat a vital tool for anyone seeking to harness Web3 communication's full potential.
